# Project Desctiption

**Project Overview:**
We are building an advanced Generative AI Chatbot, focusing on key functionalities such as user authentication, chat history storage.

**Required Features:**

1. **Authentication by Credentials:**
   - Users should be able to sign up and log in using a username and password.
   - Only registered users will have access to the chatbot and their own chat history.
2. **Chat with the Chatbot:**
   - Users can start conversations with the AI-powered chatbot, which generates responses based on user input and maintains the flow of conversation.
3. **Chat History Storage:**
   - Conversations will be securely stored in a database (e.g., MongoDB, SQLite).
   - Users will be able to view their past chat history for a personalized experience.

**Bonus Features (Optional):**

- **OAuth Authentication:**
  Integrate OAuth to allow users to authenticate through third-party services (Google, Facebook), offering a seamless and secure login experience.
- **New Chat Tab:**
  Create a new chat tab allowing users to start a new conversation without losing previous chat data. Users should be able to easily switch between ongoing chats and new ones.

**Technology:**
You are free to use any technology of your choice, whether it's for web, mobile, or any other platform. Choose the technology that you are most comfortable with or think best suits the project!

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your innovative solutions!
